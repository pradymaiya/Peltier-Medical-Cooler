Temperature Sensor Accuracy: Ensure the DS18B20 sensor is correctly connected and calibrated. Incorrect wiring or a missing pull-up resistor might lead to inaccurate readings.
Button Debouncing: The code doesn't include debouncing for the buttons. Without debouncing, the buttons might register multiple presses when pressed once. You can add a simple software debounce by adding a delay after registering a button press, as seen in the code (delay(500);). This may work for slower presses, but for more reliable operation, a more sophisticated debounce method might be needed.
Power Requirements: The Peltier modules consume significant power. Ensure that your power supply can handle the combined load of the Arduino, Peltier modules, fan, and other components. If the power supply is insufficient, the system might behave erratically.
PWM Control: The code uses PWM to control the Peltier modules and fan. Ensure the PWM pins used (9, 10, 11, and 5) are capable of handling the current required by the modules and fan. If not, you may need to use MOSFETs or relays to switch the high current loads.
Cooling Efficiency: The Peltier modules can get very hot on one side and cold on the other. Ensure the heatsink and fan are adequately sized and properly installed to dissipate the heat. Without efficient cooling, the Peltier modules may overheat, reducing their effectiveness or potentially damaging them.
Testing:
Test the temperature reading: Verify that the DS18B20 sensor is accurately reading the temperature by displaying the readings on the LCD.
Check button functionality: Press the buttons and observe if the target temperature is being adjusted correctly.
Monitor cooling: Observe how the Peltier modules and fan respond to changes in temperature. The modules should activate when the current temperature exceeds the target temperature and deactivate when it's below.
Error Handling and Improvements:
Add Feedback: Consider adding visual or audio feedback (e.g., an LED or buzzer) to indicate when the target temperature is reached or if there's an error (like a sensor malfunction).
Temperature Hysteresis: To avoid rapid switching of the Peltier modules near the target temperature, you might introduce a small hysteresis, where the modules turn on or off slightly above or below the target temperature range.
