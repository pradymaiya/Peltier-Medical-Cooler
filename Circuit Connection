Peltier Modules:Connect the positive terminal of each Peltier module to a separate PWM-enabled digital pin 9, 10, 11 on the Arduino Mega.Connect the negative terminals of all Peltier modules to the ground (GND) of the Arduino Mega.
Heatsink and Fan:Connect the fan's positive terminal to a PWM-enabled digital pin 5.Connect the fan's negative terminal to the ground (GND) of the Arduino Mega.
Temperature Sensor DS18B20:CC → 5V on Arduino, GND → GND on Arduino, Data → Digital pin 2 on Arduino, Pull-up resistor (4.7kΩ) between Data and VCC
LCD Display :SDA → SDA on Arduino Mega, SCL → SCL on Arduino Mega, VCC → 5V on Arduino Mega, GND → GND on Arduino Mega
Buttons (3 buttons for setting temperature): Button 1: Connect one side to digital pin 3 and the other side to GND., Button 2: Connect one side to digital pin 4 and the other side to GND., Button 3: Connect one side to digital pin 6 and the other side to GND.
